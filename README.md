## Introduction

Knee osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease that affects millions worldwide. Accurate grading of KOA severity is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. This project uses ResNet to classify KOA severity levels from X-ray images, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of labeled knee X-ray images. The images are categorized based on the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system, which is widely used for assessing KOA severity.

## Model Architecture

The model employs ResNet, a deep convolutional neural network, known for its ability to handle complex image recognition tasks effectively.

## Preprocessing

- Normalization of pixel values.
- Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve model robustness.

## Training and Evaluation

- The model is trained using a dataset split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results

The ResNet model achieved high accuracy in classifying the severity of knee osteoarthritis, demonstrating its potential in assisting healthcare professionals.
